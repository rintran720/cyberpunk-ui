# Cursor Rules - Natural, Human-Like Code Style

## General Philosophy

Write code that feels natural and human-written, not overly polished or AI-generated. Prioritize pragmatism over perfection.

## Code Style Guidelines

### Comments & Documentation

- Keep comments minimal and only when necessary
- Avoid verbose JSDoc comments for simple functions
- Use inline comments sparingly - code should be self-explanatory
- Prefer TODO comments over perfect implementations when appropriate
- Don't over-explain obvious code

### Variable Naming

- Use concise, natural variable names (e.g., `data` instead of `userDataObject`)
- Allow some abbreviations if they're clear in context (e.g., `idx`, `temp`, `val`)
- Don't over-describe in variable names - context matters
- Use `i`, `j` for loop indices (not `index`, `counter`)
- Prefer shorter names for local variables

### Code Structure

- Don't over-engineer - simple solutions are often better
- Allow minor inconsistencies if they make sense pragmatically
- Use early returns liberally - don't nest unnecessarily
- Prefer functional style but don't force it everywhere
- Mix patterns naturally - don't be dogmatic about one approach

### TypeScript

- Use `any` sparingly but don't avoid it when it's the pragmatic choice
- Prefer type inference over explicit types when obvious
- Don't create overly complex type definitions for simple cases
- Use `as` assertions when you know better than TypeScript
- Allow some `@ts-ignore` comments when dealing with third-party libs

### React Patterns

- Use hooks naturally - don't over-optimize with useMemo/useCallback
- Prefer inline styles/classes over complex abstractions when simple
- Don't create wrapper components for trivial cases
- Use default props or optional chaining - both are fine
- Mix controlled and uncontrolled components as needed

### Error Handling

- Don't wrap everything in try-catch - let errors bubble when appropriate
- Use simple error messages - no need for elaborate error objects
- Console.error is fine for debugging - don't over-engineer logging

### Testing & Quality

- Write tests for critical paths, not everything
- Allow some technical debt if it's not blocking
- Don't refactor working code just for "clean code" principles
- Prefer working code over perfect code

### Code Examples to Avoid (AI-like patterns)

- ❌ Overly descriptive variable names: `const userAuthenticationTokenObject = ...`
- ❌ Verbose comments: `// This function takes a user object and returns...`
- ❌ Perfect JSDoc for simple functions
- ❌ Over-abstracted utility functions
- ❌ Unnecessary type guards and validations
- ❌ Overly structured error handling
- ❌ Perfect code organization (allow some messiness)

### Code Examples to Prefer (Human-like patterns)

- ✅ `const token = ...` instead of `const userAuthenticationToken = ...`
- ✅ `// handle edge case` instead of long explanations
- ✅ Direct solutions over abstractions
- ✅ `if (!data) return null` instead of elaborate checks
- ✅ Mix of styles and patterns
- ✅ Some shortcuts and pragmatic choices

## Specific to This Project

- This is a UI component library - prioritize usability over perfection
- Storybook stories should be practical, not exhaustive
- CSS classes can be verbose (Tailwind) but keep logic simple
- Component props should be intuitive, not over-typed

## Remember

- Humans write code that works, not perfect code
- Some inconsistency is natural and acceptable
- Pragmatic solutions > theoretical perfection
- Code should feel like it was written by a person, not a machine
